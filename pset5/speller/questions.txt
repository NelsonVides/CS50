0. What is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis?
    The longest word to be checked in our dictionaries

1. According to its man page, what does getrusage do?
    returns resource usage measures for who

2. Per that same man page, how many members are in a variable of type struct rusage?
    16

3. Why do you think we pass before and after by reference (instead of by value) to calculate, even though we’re not changing their contents?
    Because C requires passing structs by reference in functions, because by value, the size would be too big

4. Explain as precisely as possible, in a paragraph or more, how main goes about reading words from a file. In other words, convince us that you indeed understand how that function’s for loop works.
        Speller goes through the characters of the file, reading one by one
        Each time we access the file characters by fgetc, the stream of the
    file moves by a byte, therefore the "for" loop keeps reading
    characters just one by one.
        Then, within the loop and with just one character at a time, it
    analises if such character is alphabetical, numerical, the end of the
    word, or even more importantly the end of the file (EOF), and copies
    such in the "word" array, finishing it with the '\0' needed. Then,
    it passes this word-array to the checker.

5. Why do you think we used fgetc to read each word’s characters one at a time rather than use fscanf with a format string like "%s" to read whole words at a time? Put another way, what problems might arise by relying on fscanf alone?


6. Why do you think we declared the parameters for check and load as const (which means "constant")?
    Because we do not want to modify them at any time?
